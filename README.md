PowerShell script to zip `extension` directory for upload to Chrome Web Store also included because Windows doesn't have a 	`zip` command.

Oddities
---

Although primarily created with the [Chrome Dev Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-dev-editor-develop/pnoffddplpippgcfjdhbmhkofpnaalpg?hl=en) on a Chromebook, some image editing was done on Windows, and consequently, I decided to zip the extension from Windows, necessitating the included PowerShell script.
